### What to find on Github?

I usually put some of my own private projects up here. They are just for fun, don't look for polished features here. You can of course browse and use all my public code.

### Open Source

If you have a very good idea and if you also think, I will be of use, contact me, I was always looking for a cool project, but I am not fully convinced for one thing yet.
